[[release-notes-5.0.0-m5-junit-platform]]
==== JUnit Platform

===== Bug Fixes

* `MethodSelector.getMethodParameterTypes()` no longer returns `null` for parameter
  types if the selector is created via `DiscoverySelectors` without explicit parameter
  types. Specifically, if parameter types are not supplied and cannot be deduced, an
  empty string will be returned. Similarly, if parameter types are not explicitly
  supplied but can be deduced (e.g, via a supplied `Method` reference),
  `getMethodParameterTypes()` now returns a string containing the deduced parameter
  types.
* A `NullPointerException` thrown by `ConsoleLauncher` in `Details.TREE` mode was fixed
  by falling back to printing throwable's `toString()` representation.
* `DefaultLauncher` now catches and warns about exceptions generated by an engine in its
  discovery and execution phases. Other engines are processed normally.

===== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The deprecated `--hide-details` option of the `ConsoleLauncher` has been removed; use
  `--details none` instead.
* The following previously deprecated methods have been removed.
  - `junit-platform-engine`: `Node.execute(EngineExecutionContext)`
  - `junit-platform-commons`: `ReflectionUtils.findAllClassesInClasspathRoot(Path, Predicate, Predicate)`
* The `junit-platform-surefire-provider` now requires `maven-surefire-plugin` version
  2.20 or higher.
* The `isLeaf()` method of the `org.junit.platform.engine.support.hierarchical.Node`
  interface has been removed.

===== New Features and Improvements

* When using `DiscoverySelectors` to select a method by its _fully qualified method name_
  or by providing `methodParameterTypes` as a comma-separated string, it is now possible
  to describe array parameter types using _source code syntax_ such as `int[]` for a
  primitive array and `java.lang.String[]` for an object array. Furthermore, it is now
  possible to describe multidimensional array types using either the JVM's internal String
  representation (e.g., `[[[I` for `int[][][]`, `[[Ljava.lang.String;` for
  `java.lang.String[][]`, etc.) or _source code syntax_ (e.g., `boolean[][][]`,
  `java.lang.Double[][]`, etc.).
* The JUnit Platform Gradle plugin task `junitPlatformTest` can now be accessed
  directly during the configuration phase of a build.
* When a `TestEngine` is discovered via Java's `ServiceLoader` mechanism, an attempt
  will now be made to determine the location from which the engine class was loaded,
  and if the location URL is available, it will be logged at configuration-level.


[[release-notes-5.0.0-m5-junit-jupiter]]
==== JUnit Jupiter

===== Bug Fixes

* `@ParameterizedTest` arguments are no longer resolved for lifecycle methods and test
  class constructors to improve interoperability with regular and parameterized test
  methods with different parameter lists.

===== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* In order to ensure the _composability_ of all supported extension APIs in JUnit
  Jupiter, several methods in existing APIs have been renamed.
** See <<release-notes-5.0.0-m5-migration-extension-api>> for details.
* The `arguments()` method in the `ArgumentsProvider` API in the `junit-jupiter-params`
  module has been renamed to `provideArguments()`.
* The `create()` factory method in `ObjectArrayArguments` in the `junit-jupiter-params`
  module has been renamed to `arguments()`.
* The `names` property of `@MethodSource` has been renamed to `value`.

| `TestTemplateInvocationContextProvider` | `supports()` | `supportsTestTemplate()`
| `TestTemplateInvocationContextProvider` | `provide()`  | `provideTestTemplateInvocationContexts()`
|===

===== New Features and Improvements

* `Assertions.assertAll()` now tracks exceptions of any type (as opposed to only tracking
  exceptions of type `AssertionError`), unless the exception is a _blacklisted_ exception
  in which case it will be immediately rethrown.
* If a `@ParameterizedTest` accepts an array as an argument, the string representation of
  the array will now be converted to a human readable format when generating the display
  name for invocations of the parameterized test.
* The `@EnumSource` now provides an enum constant selection mode that controls how the
  supplied names are interpreted. Supported modes include `INCLUDE` and `EXCLUDE`
  as well as regular expression pattern matching modes `MATCH_ALL` and `MATCH_ANY`.
* Extensions may now share state across top-level test classes by using the `Store` of the
  newly introduced engine-level `ExtensionContext`.
* Argument providing methods referenced using `@MethodSource` may now return instances of
  `DoubleStream`, `IntStream`, and `LongStream` directly.


[[release-notes-5.0.0-m5-junit-vintage]]
==== JUnit Vintage

===== Bug Fixes

* The `VintageTestEngine` no longer filters out test classes declared as static member
  classes, since they are valid JUnit 4 test classes.
* The `VintageTestEngine` no longer attempts to execute abstract classes as test classes.
  Instead, a warning is now logged stating that such classes are excluded.
